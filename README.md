# Domination4v4
Here are the latest files for Domination 4v4

**Update 0.4:**
Changed the B flag on Clubhouse slightly indoors so the lighting issue (seeing inside from outside) is hopefully better.

Added a new map: 'Manhattan Bridge'.

**Update 0.45:**
Updated the scoring system so you don't lose points if you have flag majority

Updated the win conditions so win-draw-loss are correct when time runs out
